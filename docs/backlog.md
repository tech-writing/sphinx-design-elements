# Backlog

- Documentation: Render on multiple themes, like `sphinx-design`.
- From `sphinx-design` 
  - horizontal card (grid row inside card, picture on left)
  - subtitle for card (see <https://m3.material.io/components/cards/guidelines>)
- hyper: Maintain a synthetic intersphinx inventory for caching titles from
  extracted HTML pages, so that subsequent invocations do not need to
  extract titles over and over again.
- shield: Derive fundamental implementation from [sphinx_toolbox.shields]?
